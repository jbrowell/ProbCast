# ProbCast

ProbCast is an `R` Package under continuous development by researchers at the University of Strathclyde. It is a collection of functions for probabilistic forecasting (mainly wrappers for qunatile and semi-parametric regression model fitting functions), cross-validation, evaluation and visualisation. Central to ProbCast is the data class `MultiQR`, for storing the results of multiple quantile regression, and methods for working with `MultiQR` objects.

## Set-up

You can install the latest version of ProbCast using:

    # install.packages("devtools")
    library(devtools)
    install_github("jbrowell/ProbCast")
    
The latest release is:

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/143147931.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/143147931)
    
It may be necessary to set the following:

    Sys.setenv(R_REMOTES_NO_ERRORS_FROM_WARNINGS="true")

## Usage

The package includes a script `Example.R` which demonstrates much of ProbCast's functionallity.

## Guide for Contributors
Contributors should follow the following guidelines:
- Open new branches when adding new functinoality, or making changes to exisig functions
- Raise *issues* when adding functionality, and identifying and fixing bugs
- Use rogygen to include documentation with each new function. Include helpful notes on all inputs, outputs, and wokrings of the function
- Include helpful comments throughout code
- Add yourself as @author to functions that you have "ownership" of
- Invite others to review pull requests (check for documentation, back compatability, confilcts...)
